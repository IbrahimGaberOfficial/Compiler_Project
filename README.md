2. **Edit the Code:**
   - Open the `code.cpp` file in a text editor.
   - Modify the code as needed.

3. **Run the Compiler:**
   - Execute the `TheScanner.exe` file to compile and run your modified code.
   - The output will be displayed in the console.

**Method 2: Building and Running from Source Code**

1. **Open the Project in Visual Studio:**
   - Launch Visual Studio and open the project solution.

2. **Edit the Code:**
   - Navigate to the `/files/code.cpp` file and make necessary modifications.

3. **Build and Run:**
   - Build the project to compile the source code.
   - Run the project to execute the compiled code.
   - The output will be displayed in the Visual Studio output window.

**Note:** Ensure you have the necessary development environment set up, including a C++ compiler and Visual Studio, to run the project using the second method.
